# 📘 Probability & Random Processes — Computational Code Companion

*A repository showcasing Python and R code that illustrates key ideas in probability and random processes.*

This project contains **curated, well-structured code examples** demonstrating how to simulate, visualize, and computationally explore:

- Distributions (CDFs, PDFs, PMFs)
- Joint distributions & dependence
- Convergence concepts (law of large numbers, CLT, convergence in probability)
- Generating functions
- Markov chains
- Renewal processes
- Queueing models
- Martingales
- Brownian motion & Ito calculus
- Transformations of random variables
- Monte Carlo methods

Each concept is illustrated with side-by-side **Python & R code**, heavily commented, making this a computational companion for learning or teaching probability.
